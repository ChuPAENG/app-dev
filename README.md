## Synopsis
*Stranger Things* is an enthralling sci-fi horror series that takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, during the 1980s. The story revolves around a group of young friends who embark on a thrilling adventure when their friend, Will Byers, mysteriously disappears.

## Main Characters
- *Mike Wheeler* - A determined and loyal friend who takes the lead in the group.

## Memorable Scene
*Billy Sacrifice (season 3)* (https://youtu.be/gXdA18JCJqY)
*We’ll be honest, Billy didn’t do much to redeem himself in the episodes leading up to the season 3 finale. That being said, he was still just a teen possessed by the Mind Flayer, so it’s not like he had time to show that he could change for the better. His final moments, at least, make it clear that he was not entirely cruel, and could have been a good person if he tried.

As the battle against the Mind Flayer unfolds in Hawkins’ mall, Billy protects Eleven by standing up and facing the monster, only to be impaled in front of his sister and her friends. He then dies in Max’s arms, telling her “I’m sorry”. We’re not crying, we just have a demogorgon in our eye.
